# README Instructions

Replace the contents of the README.md file with a beautifully-formatted Markdown file including

- ~~a plain-language description of your project~~
- two badges at the top of the README.md file showing the result of the latest build/test workflow of both the machine learning client and web app subsystems.
- ~~the names of all teammates as links to their GitHub profiles in the README.md file.~~
- ~~instructions for how to configure and run all parts of your project for any developer on any platform - these instructions must work!~~
- instructions for how to set up any environment variables and import any starter data into the database, as necessary, for the system to operate correctly when run.

## Project Description
For our web-application we are creating a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. With our app, users will be able to use their camera to play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.

## Configuration Instructions
To run the program for yourself, run the following command in your Terminal:
```
docker-compose up --build
```
Now that the containers have been built, you can navigate [here](http://127.0.0.1:5003/) to play the game!
