# README Instructions

Replace the contents of the README.md file with a beautifully-formatted Markdown file including

- a plain-language description of your project
- two badges at the top of the README.md file showing the result of the latest build/test workflow of both the machine learning client and web app subsystems.
- the names of all teammates as links to their GitHub profiles in the README.md file.
- instructions for how to configure and run all parts of your project for any developer on any platform - these instructions must work!
- instructions for how to set up any environment variables and import any starter data into the database, as necessary, for the system to operate correctly when run.
- if there are any "secret" configuration files, such as .env or similar files, that are not included in the version control repository, examples of these files, such as env.example, with dummy data must be included in the repository and exact instructions for how to create the proper configuration files and what their contents should be must be supplied to the course admins by the due date.
